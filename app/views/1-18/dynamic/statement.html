      <p class="govuk-body">After the exam board has updated the learner's registration status on this service, you can use this service to request a statement of achievement. You will need to confirm:</p>

      <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
        <li>the learner's detail are correct</li>
        <li>the learner's achievements are correct.</li>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">If the learner's details or achievements are wrong or missing</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can add or update a learner's English and maths achievement and industry placement completion status in the 'Manage learner T Level records' part of this service.</p>

      <p class="govuk-body">You need to speak to the exam board if the learner's details or technical qualification component results need changing.</p>
