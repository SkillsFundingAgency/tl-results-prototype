        Appeal a grade after the deadline
      </h1>

      <p>We mark all results as final once the appeal deadline has passed, so that we can calculate the learner's overall grade.</p>

      <p>If a grade is being appealed after the deadline for appeals, we need to make a manual change to the grade record.</p>

      <p>This change will take up to 3 working days.</p>
