        </h1>
        <p class="govuk-body">The Manage T Level results service is run by the Education and Skills Funding Agency (ESFA), an executive agency of the Department for Education (DfE).</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>tell us if T Level details are correct</li>

          <li>upload, download and amend student registrations</li>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Signing in
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">In order to use Manage T Level results you need a DfE Sign-in account. You need to sign in with the work email address and password you set up for DfE Sign-in.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If you have not got a DfE Sign-in account, ask someone with an ‘approver’ role within your organisation to set up an account for you and give you access to Manage T Level results. DfE Sign-in will send you an email so you can verify your work email address.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Signing out
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">Select ‘sign out’ in the top right-hand corner of the screen to sign out and return to the introduction page. For security reasons you should always sign out when you have finished using the service.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Timeout
        </h2>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Finding the service
        </h2>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
            Awarding organisation roles and permissions
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">A user can be given more than one role.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Site Administrator</strong> – has all roles: T Levels Reviewer, Providers Editor, Registrations Editor</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><strong>T Levels Reviewer</strong> – reviews T Level Technical Qualification titles and confirms that details are correct or not</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Providers Editor</strong> – can enter and amend the T Levels each provider is offering</p>
        <p class="govuk-body"><strong>Registrations Editor</strong> – an upload, amend and delete student registrations</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">T Level Review tasks</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">From the Manage T Levels results home page if you select ‘T Levels’ the service will ask you to review the Technical Qualification details of any T Levels that have not yet been confirmed. This happens automatically for any T Levels awaiting confirmation.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">In your review you should check that the Technical Qualification details are correct for your T Levels. This includes the T Level’s Core Component and Specialisms. This is important because these details will appear on students’ certificates.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You do not need to review the route title. If all the details are correct you should select ‘yes’. You will then get a message to make it clear that the T Level’s Technical Qualification details have been confirmed.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">When you have confirmed all your T Levels’ Technical Qualification details you can still view them to check everything remains correct.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">If during your review you find any Technical Qualification details are wrong or missing, select ‘no’ to query it with us. We will then investigate your query and update you within 3 working days.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">You can still query a confirmed T Level’s Technical Qualification details at a later date, if you think the information is not accurate anymore.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          Providers Editor tasks
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">From the Manage T Levels results home page if you select ‘Providers’ you can tell us which T Levels a provider is offering. You find providers by searching on their name. You can then select which T Levels to add or remove. We recommend that you only add a T Level to a provider once the T Level’s details have been confirmed as correct in the ‘T Levels’ section.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">
          Registrations Editor tasks
        </h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">From the Manage T Levels results home page if you select ‘Registrations’ you can upload student registration data. You can also download registration data you have already uploaded, and amend student details.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">All files need to be in CSV format.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Each file needs to include, in this order:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
          <li>ULN (Unique Learner Number) – 10 digits</li>
          <li>T Level Core</li>
          <li>T Level Specialism 1</li>
          <li>T Level Specialism 2</li>
          <li>Start date – DD/MM/YY</li>
          <li>Assessment window start – DD/MM/YY</li>
          <li>Assessment window end – DD/MM/YY</li>
          <li>UKPRN (UK Provider Reference Number) – 8 digits</li>
        </ul>
